## SteveJobzniak's MPV Utilities

* **[auto-keep-gui-open](https://github.com/SteveJobzniak/mpv-tools/blob/master/auto-keep-gui-open.lua)**  
  Intelligently switches mpv's "keep-open" behavior based on whether you are
  running in video-mode or audio-only mode.

* **[cycle-video-rotate](https://github.com/SteveJobzniak/mpv-tools/blob/master/cycle-video-rotate.lua)**  
  Allows you to perform video rotation which perfectly cycles through all 360
  degrees without any glitches.

* **[multi-command-if](https://github.com/SteveJobzniak/mpv-tools/blob/master/multi-command-if.lua)**  
  Very powerful conditional logic and multiple action engine for your
  keybindings, without having to write a single line of code!

* **[quick-scale](https://github.com/SteveJobzniak/mpv-tools/blob/master/quick-scale.lua)**  
  Quickly scale the video player to a target size, with full control over target
  scale and max scale. Helps you effortlessly resize a video to fit on your
  desktop, or any other video dimensions you need!
